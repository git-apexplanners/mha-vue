        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          At Michael Hart Architects, we believe that architecture is more than just designing buildings; it's about creating spaces that enhance the human experience. Our approach is centered around understanding the unique needs and aspirations of our clients, the specific context of each site, and the broader environmental and social considerations.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          We follow a collaborative design process that involves close consultation with our clients at every stage, from initial concept to final construction. This ensures that the end result not only meets but exceeds expectations, delivering spaces that are both beautiful and functional.

        <p>
          Our architectural philosophy is guided by three core principles:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We are committed to environmentally responsible design that minimizes resource consumption and carbon footprint.</li>
          <li><strong>Contextual Sensitivity:</strong> We believe that buildings should respond to and enhance their surroundings, whether natural or urban.</li>
          <li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> We prioritize the comfort, well-being, and experience of the people who will use our buildings.</li>
        </ul>
